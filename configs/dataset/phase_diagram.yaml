# NOTE: The dataset provides RAW, UNFILTERED Materials Project data.
# Task-specific filtering (SMACT, max_stoichiometry, energy thresholds) 
# is applied at the Environment level (see configs/environment/).

# Elements for the chemical system
elements:
  - Li
  - O
# Optional: Materials Project thermo types (only filtering applied at dataset level)
