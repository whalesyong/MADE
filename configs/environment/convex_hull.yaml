# NOTE: The environment applies TASK-SPECIFIC FILTERING to the raw dataset
# to define the "effective ground truth" for discovery. All metrics (recall,
# precision, novelty) are computed against this filtered ground truth.

budget: 5

# dataset and oracle instances are provided by the application at call-site

# Initialization mode
start_with_all_stable: true # false means start with elemental references only, true means start with all stable entries from MP
compute_elemental_from_oracle: true # if true, compute elemental reference energies using oracle from dataset structures

# Stability thresholds
stability_tolerance: 0.1 # Energy tolerance (eV/atom) for considering a phase stable relative to the convex hull
include_near_stable_from_ground_truth: true # Include GT entries within stability_tolerance of the hull as stable

# FILTERING: These filters define what phases are discoverable in this task
filter_by_smact: true # Filter out entries that don't pass SMACT validity checks (chemically implausible)
max_stoichiometry: 20 # Filter out entries with > N atoms per unit cell (null = no filtering)
