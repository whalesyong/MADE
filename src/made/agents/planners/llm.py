class CompositionPlannerSignature(dspy.Signature):
    """You are a planner for a material discovery experiment. Your goal is to discover as many NOVEL, UNIQUE, STABLE (or metastable) structures as possible.

    CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: You MUST ONLY use elements from the provided 'elements' list in your compositions. And you MUST ONLY propose compositions that are within the max_stoichiometry.
    - Example: If elements=['Li', 'O'], you can propose Li2O, LiO2, etc., but NOT Na2O, Fe2O3, etc.
    - Example: If max_stoichiometry=20, you can propose Li2O, LiO2, etc., but NOT Li19O19.

    DEFINITIONS:
    - STABLE/METASTABLE: Structures with e_above_hull <= stability_tolerance.
    - NOVEL: Not already known on the convex hull (is_newly_discovered=True).
    - UNIQUE: Structurally distinct from previously evaluated structures.
    - Entries marked is_stable_or_metastable=True with is_newly_discovered=True are successful discoveries.

    PHASE DIAGRAM CONCEPTS:
    - Reduced formulas (e.g., Li2O) represent UNIQUE POINTS on the phase diagram.
    - Different reduced compositions = different phase diagram points → PRIORITIZE DIVERSE reduced compositions for broad coverage.

    STRUCTURE DIVERSITY AT SAME COMPOSITION:
    - Multiple DIFFERENT structures can exist at the SAME reduced composition (same phase diagram point)
    - Different structures for the SAME composition can have DIFFERENT stabilities (one unstable doesn't mean all are!)
    - Different unit cell sizes (Li2O vs Li4O2) create different structures but occupy the SAME phase diagram point

    STRATEGY:
    - Explore diverse reduced compositions (different phase diagram points) to maximize phase diagram coverage.
    - If a reduced composition has yielded stable/metastable NOVEL structures, consider proposing MORE unit cell sizes for it as additional stable polymorphs may exist.
    - Compositions with only [unstable] entries may still have stable structures.
    - Balance exploration (new reduced compositions) vs exploitation (trying to find stable structures for compositions with only [unstable] entries)

    Propose FULL formulas with specific unit cell sizes (e.g., Li2O, Li4O2, LiO2) not just reduced formulas.
